<h3>How I began to crochet </h3>
<p>When I was young I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. My grandma tried teaching me a little bit of everything she knew, including crochet, knitting, tatting, embroidering, and quilting. Out of all these crocheting was always my favorite, and knitting was probably my least favorite. I’ve always enjoyed making blankets, even though it takes forever. I usually always have a blanket at least started, although I don’t have much time anymore to work on them.</p>

<h3>Favorite Pattern </h3>

<p>My favorite pattern is probably the basket weave stitch. This pattern tends to take a while because it uses a smaller weighted yarn typically. You could use a heavier weight, but then it’s more difficult to see the “basket weave” appearance. It’s a fairly simple pattern consisting of mostly front and back post double crochets and a few single crochets.</p>

<p> I enjoy making blankets for other people, especially baby blankets, so when I’m asked to make someone a blanket I always ask if I can use this pattern first!</p>

<h3>What I use to crochet </h3>

<ul>
	<li>Pattern if doing a new stitch, otherwise trying to remember an old stitch</li>
	<li>Correct size crochet hook based on yarn weight</li>
	<li>Yarn</li>
</ul>
