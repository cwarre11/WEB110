	<h3>Web Site Goal</h3>
	<p>To tell everyone about working at Amazon. Most articles online are from a journalist who haven't actually worked for Amazon and is just based off what they've heard or possibly what they've made up.</p>
	<p>This will be based off of a Fulfillment Center, which is the most common building type. There are also delivery stations but they're way smaller and employ way fewer people.</p>
	
	<h3>Title Names</h3>
	<p>Hiring Process</p>
	<p>Orientation</p>
	<p>First Days of Work</p>
	<p>Normal Work Day</p>
	
	<h3>What my form will be</h3>
	<p>Ask for opinions from others that have/do work for Amazon. It would help me gather information for delivery stations and from delivery drivers.</p>
	
	<h3>Where I'll obtain information</h3>
	<p>Most of the information will come from my personal experience from working at Amazon. Some will come from Amazon groups I'm currently a part of where we discuss/complain about our jobs. </p>
	<p>Pictures used will have to be obtained from online because we normally aren't allowed to have phones at Amazon, so I can't take any pictures myself. Taking a picture inside Amazon without permission could get me fired if I was caught.</p>
